# World Population-Dashboard
Dashboard of Country Data

Streamlit was used to create the interactive web application known as Country Data Dashboard. This Dashboard gives users access to country-specific data and visualizations, such as interactive maps, demographic information, and geographic specifics.

## Features
- Choose a nation to see specifics like the capital city.
- **The Continent**: View the continent the country belongs to.
- **The Entire Area**: Total area in km².
- **Density of Population**: People per km².
- **Rate of Growth**: Population growth percentage.
- **Proportion of the Global Population**: Country's share of world population.
- Use interactive bar charts to see how the population has changed over time.
- A map showing the location of the nation and identifying its capital.

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates how to create a dashboard using Python that integrates population statistics, geolocation data, and visualization tools. It incorporates libraries like pandas, geopandas, folium, and plotly to provide a smooth and educational user experience.
